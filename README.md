# Product Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a Product Recommendation System that suggests similar products based on user interaction. When a user clicks on a product, the system intelligently analyzes that product’s features and recommends related or similar products, improving user experience and engagement.

The system is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to integrate into e-commerce or product-based platforms.

## How It Works

1. User clicks or views a product

2. The system identifies the selected product

3. Product features are compared with other products

4. Similarity scores are calculated

5. Top related products are returned as recommendations

## Technology Used

1. Python:
Core programming language used to build the recommendation logic and backend.

2. Scikit-learn:
Used for implementing machine learning techniques and calculating similarity between products.

3. TF-IDF Vectorizer:
Converts product descriptions into numerical vectors to measure textual similarity between products.

4. E-commerce Dataset:
Real-world or structured e-commerce product data used for training and generating product recommendations.

5. Django:
Backend framework used to manage APIs, business logic, and communication between the frontend and recommendation engine.

6. JavaScript:
Handles user interactions such as product selection and dynamically displays recommended products.

7. HTML & CSS:
Used to design and style the user interface.

8. Database (SQLite):
Stores product details, categories, and related metadata.
